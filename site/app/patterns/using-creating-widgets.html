        <h2>Using and Creating Esri Widgets</h2>
        <p>Widgets—or as they are known in Angular 1.x, directives—are used and
            developed in several ways. Out of the box Esri widgets can be
            loaded and used as-is, Esri view models provide the ability to
            combine a custom user interface with existing Esri widget logic, and
            completely custom Angular directives without reference to any widgets or
            view models can also be developed to work alongside the Esri JSAPI.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Esri Widgets</h3>
        <p>Widgets are usually comprised of properties, methods, and a user interface.
            The Esri JSAPI offers a collection of
            <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/api-reference/esri-widgets-Widget.html">built-in widgets</a>
            that can be loaded with
            <a href="/docs/#/api/esri.core.factory:esriLoader#methods_require"><code>esriLoader.require()</code></a>
            and constructed once there is
            <a href="#/patterns/references-to-views">reference to</a>
            a map view or scene view. This pattern also recommends that you properly tear down and
            <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/api-reference/esri-widgets-Widget.html#destroy"><code>destroy()</code></a>
            widgets when Angular scope is being destroyed.
        </p>
        <!-- <div hljs=""></div> -->
        <p>Example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#/examples/search">Search</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Esri View Models</h3>
        <p><a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/guide/whats-new/index.html#Developerfriendly_widgets_4">View models</a>
            allow for the separation of a widget's methods and properties from
            its UI presentation. By taking advantage of view models, you can rely
            on Esri widget functionality, but apply custom directive templates and styles.
            For example, the included
            <a href="/docs/#/api/esri.map.directive:esriHomeButton"><code>&lt;esri-home-button&gt;</code></a>
            Angular directive relies on the Esri
            <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/api-reference/esri-widgets-Home-HomeViewModel.html"><code>HomeViewModel</code></a>
            in its controller logic and also defines its own look and feel.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#/examples/home-button">Home Button</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Custom Angular Directives</h3>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#/examples/webscene-slides">Work with Slides in a WebScene</a></li>
        </ul>

        <!-- <p>The map and scene view directives each include both <code>on-create</code>
            and <code>on-load</code> events that pass a reference to the underlying map or
            scene view object to a callback function. The <code>on-create</code> event is
            fired immediately after the view has been created (i.e. <code>new MapView()</code>)
            and the <code>on-load</code> event fires after the view's
            <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/api-reference/esri-views-MapView.html#then">promise has been resolved</a>.
        </p> 
        <p>The map and scene view directives also include an <code>on-error</code> event
            that passes the error information object if a view's promise has been rejected.
            This can be useful, for example, if you wish to use a scene view directive but
            need to <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/sample-code/scene-webgl-support/index.html">gracefully handle</a>
            browsers that do not support WebGL. Most examples using the scene view directive
            also demonstrate how to use this binding.
        </p>
        <p>See these examples:</p>
        <h4>On-create</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#/examples/scene-view">Scene View</a></li>
            <li><a href="#/examples/search">Search</a></li>
            <li><a href="#/examples/home-button">Home Button</a></li>
            <li><a href="#/examples/scene-toggle-elevation">Toggle the Basemap's Elevation Layer</a></li>
            <li><a href="#/examples/property-binding">Property Binding</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>On-load</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#/examples/webscene-slides">Work with Slides in a WebScene</a></li>
        </ul> -->
