        <h2>Create Your Own Factories</h2>
        <p>Knowing how to get references to map and layer instances from parent controllers
            or unrelated controllers can provide a lot of flexibility in how Angular v1 apps can be
            structured and organized. The
            <a href="#/patterns/references-to-map-and-layers#Registry">Registry Pattern</a>
            provided by <em>angular-esri-map</em> already allows for map object
            states to be shared and accessed in a common service.
        </p>
        <p>As your application continues to grow, it may benefit from having its own custom factory that
            can be injected into any directive or controller. Factories using this kind of approach 
            are fully in charge of maintaining and manipulating data models.
            For more information, see Todd Motto's
            <a href="https://toddmotto.com/rethinking-angular-js-controllers/">Rethinking AngularJS Controllers</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Below is an example of a "MapUtilsFactory" that is injected into a controller.
            It is responsible for loading Esri modules and changing a property of a <code>FeatureLayer</code> instance,
            while the controller that uses this factory relies on it for getting access to the <code>FeatureLayer</code>
            to add it to the map.
        </p>
        <p>The overall workflow is:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Establish a factory with its own Angular <code>$q</code> deferred.</li>
            <li>Return the deferred's promise in a method that other directives and controllers can call.</li>
            <li>Load one or more Esri modules with <code>esriLoader</code>, such as <code>'esri/layers/FeatureLayer'</code>.</li>
            <li>Resolve the deferred with the <code>FeatureLayer</code> instance once it has been established and is ready.</li>
            <li>Then, other directives and controllers will have access to a fully loaded <code>FeatureLayer</code> instance.</li>
            <li>Rinse and repeat for other Esri modules and your own data models that the factory will control.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>See the <a href="./custom-factory.html">Custom Factory page</a> for a demonstration of this pattern. The source code is below:</p>
